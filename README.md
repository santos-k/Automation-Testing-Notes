# Selenium and Python Automation Testing

## Overview

This project demonstrates automation testing using Selenium with Python, a powerful combination for web application testing. Selenium allows you to automate browser interactions, and Python provides a scripting language for creating robust and scalable test scripts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

1. **Python:** Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Selenium WebDriver:** Install using `pip install selenium`.
3. **Web Browser Drivers:** Download and configure drivers for browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/selenium-python-automation.git
   cd selenium-python-automation

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Tools and Dependencies

### Python

- **Description:** Python is a versatile programming language that is widely used for scripting, automation, and web development.
- **Installation:** Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Selenium WebDriver

- **Description:** Selenium is an open-source tool that automates web browsers. WebDriver is the component of Selenium that allows you to programmatically control a browser.
- **Installation:** Install Selenium using `pip install selenium`.

### Browser Drivers

- **Description:** Browser drivers are required to interface with different web browsers. Common drivers include ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver (for Firefox), and EdgeDriver.
- **Installation:** Download the appropriate driver for your browser and ensure it's in your system PATH or provide the path in your script.

## Example Scripts

### Open Browsers

The following code snippet opens Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers using Selenium with Python:

```python
from selenium import webdriver

# Open Chrome
chrome_driver = webdriver.Chrome()
chrome_driver.maximize_window()

# Open Firefox
firefox_driver = webdriver.Firefox()
firefox_driver.maximize_window()

# Open Edge
edge_driver = webdriver.Edge()
edge_driver.maximize_window()
```

### Interact with Elements

You can interact with web elements using Selenium. Below is an example that opens a website and performs a search:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys

# Open the website
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("https://www.example.com")

# Find the search box by its name attribute
search_box = driver.find_element("name", "q")

# Type a search query
search_box.send_keys("Automation Testing with Selenium and Python")

# Press Enter
search_box.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)

# Close the browser
driver.quit()
```

## Types of Automation Testing

1. **Unit Testing:** Testing individual units or components.
2. **Integration Testing:** Verifying interactions between different modules.
3. **Functional Testing:** Evaluating software functionality against requirements.
4. **Regression Testing:** Ensuring new changes don't break existing features.
5. **Performance Testing:** Measuring system performance under various conditions.
6. **Load Testing:** Examining system performance under specific load conditions.
7. **End-to-End Testing:** Validating the entire application flow.
